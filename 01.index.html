    <h2>
      Difference between CSS flexbox layout model and CSS grid layout model
    </h2>
    <p>1.Dimensionality and Flexibility</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Flexbox offers greater control over alignment ans space disturbution
        between items.Being one dimensional,flexbox only deals with either
        columns or rows.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grid has two-dimension layout capabilites which allow flexible widths as
        a unit of length.This compenates for the limitations in Flex.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>2.Support Type</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Content first in the flexbox layout model.</li>
      <li>Layout first in the grid layout model.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3.Alignment</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Flex direction allows developers to align elements vertically or
        horizontally,which is used when developers create and reverse rows or
        columns.
      </li>
      <li>
        CSS Grid deploys fractional measure units for grid fluidity and auto
        keyword functionality to automatically adjust columns and rows.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion-</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>CSS grids helps you create the outer layout of the webpage.You can build complex as well responsive design with this.
          This is why is called layout first.
      </li>
      <li>Flexbox mostly helps align content and move blocks.</li>
      <li>CSS Grids are 2D layouts.It works with both rows and columns.</li>
      <li>Flexbox works better in one dimension only </li>
      <li>It will use both at the same time because it is more time saving and helpful for me.So I am use both at the same place 
        or different place.
      </li>
    </ul>
